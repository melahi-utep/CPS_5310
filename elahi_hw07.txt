1. Central Difference

		a = 0.4646
		b = 3.0091
		c = 0.0000
		r = 2.3000
 
 2. Quadratic Regression
 
 3. Direct Method
 
		a = 0.3790
		b = 0.1414
		c = 0.0659
		r = 0.2844
		
Conclusion: The direct method yields better results. Since the death rate of prey is much higher than
the proliferation of predators.
